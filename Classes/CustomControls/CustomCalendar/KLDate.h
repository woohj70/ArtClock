//
//	  NOTES
//
//		(1) KLDate was created because I didn't want to mess around with time,
//			just dates. Also, some of the CFCalendar* functions are quite
//			slow on the iPhone (or at least they were in iPhone OS 2.0
//			when I created this class).
//
//		(2)	Special effort was made such that changing the iPhone's
//			regional format and timezone would not change the logical date.
//			This was needed in my application, Goalkeep, because the purpose
//			of the app was to chain together several days in a row. If you 
//			changed the timezone or the regional format, I didn't want the 
//			chain to break just because of international time issues.
//			
//		(3) Considering the above notes, it may be prudent 
//			to replace KLDate with NSDate.
